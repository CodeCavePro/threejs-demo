Three.js for VirtualNEXT
========================

As of Jul 2020 Unity Reflect for WegGL is not working (even though it compiles), 
because of gRPC is widely used and it doesn't play well with WASM or something like that.

Therefore we dicided to develop a parallel solution, still using WebGL as a platform, but on Three.js bedrock.
